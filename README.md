Alas I got the structure wrong on one upload. 
So the real project is the folder herin and not the other files. 
They are simply an earlier version not worth looking at.

It's an ANTLR project that is getting changed all the time, focused 
on building out a generic JSON document Filtering Micro Service with 
an ANTLR predicate filtering language that enables you to ask the 
service to apply to the supplied JSON document. Only the informtion
that meets the criteria is allowed through. In this way it can be
harnessed as part of an authorization mechanism for any and all JSON
document, regardless of source.
